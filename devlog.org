* Ideas
** Use Choro 1906-1947 for menus/loading
** Maybe add an illustration as if the songs are playing through a gramophone
** Cuphead-like!
* 2017-04-29 (Day 18)
** Song now plays until the end
* 2017-04-28 (Day 17)
** Fixed fog in fretboard and model shaders by switching division + clamping to smoothstep. Looks much better already!
* 2017-04-27 (Day 16)
** Tempo mapped and started MIDI chart for Samba em Prelúdio
** Made a template for MIDI charts in Logic
** Song can be specified via command-line args
* 2017-04-26 (Day 15)
** More work on O Ovo
** Video sync was totally wrong
** Fixed it
** Found out msToPos has a bug
** But happy I fixed the sync issues
** Made notes light up when being "played"
** Pretty nice to see the effect
* 2017-04-23 (Day 14)
** Audio related stuff goes into audio file
** Synchronized audio and video!
** Fixed Makefile
** Added start delay to audio files
** More work on O Ovo
* 2017-04-17 (Day 13)
** stb_vorbis added for ogg file decoding
** Decoder working!
** Audio now being played in-game!
* 2017-04-13 (Day 12)
** After a long hiatus...
** Sine wave pitch value now passed through outstream->userdata
** ...which means I can probably pass a buffer in there
* 2017-03-17 (Day 11)
** Added sound with libsoundio
** Only can play a sine wave so far, but that's a start
* 2017-03-04 (Day 10)
** msToPos function. Now able to handle tempo changes!
** Created GitHub repository and added a screenshot

* 2017-03-03 (Day 9)
** TPQ is tempo independent
** Always 480 for Logic (?)
*** I think you can select the resolution
** One unit in game world is a quarter note!
** No progress on game itself. Stuck trying to think how to map seconds to game positions

* 2017-03-02 (Day 8)
** Added a strum bar plane

* 2017-03-01 (Day 7)
** MIDI reading integrated into the game
** Game now displays MIDI charts!
** Color map for notes
** GRYBO notes! Looks pretty nice.

* 2017-02-28 (Day 6)
** Using mipmaps for measure textures. Fixes line flickering
** MIDI reading working separate from game
*** Reads note on messages, calculated measure, absolute time

* 2017-02-27 (Day 5)
** Added MSAA
** Tried to write my own midiparser
** Turns out I'm really bad at parsing files
** Used Craig Sapps' midifile instead

* 2017-02-26 (Day 4)
** Model loading with assimp. Took a few hours to realize I had to change the shaders to add a location for normals but it worked.
** Added my note model
** Realized some transforms were wrong. Reordered, relearned transform operation order
** Aligned notes with fretboard. Starting to look and feel like Guitar Hero!

* 2017-02-25 (Day 3)
** Initial camera work
** Texture for fretboard added to program
** Fretboard scrolls, but no notes yet
** Also organized the code a bit, putting shapes into a header
** Spent the afternoon relearning the little I knew from Blender and modeled a Guitar Hero style note gem. Also made a texture and a UV map!
*** Blender interpolates textures by default. A bit of a headache to solve it

* 2017-02-20 (Day 2)
** SDL2 + OpenGL context with gl3w for function pointers
*** GLAD didn't work for some reason. Can't remember why
** I can draw a triangle. Everything in 3D is triangles, so it's pretty much done

* 2017-02-19 (Day 1)
** Opened a window with SDL
