** Using mipmaps for measure textures. Fixes line flickering
** MIDI reading working separate from game
*** Reads note on messages, calculated measure, absolute time

* 2017-02-27 (Day 5)
** Added MSAA
** Tried to write my own midiparser
** Turns out I'm really bad at parsing files
** Used Craig Sapps' midifile instead

* 2017-02-26 (Day 4)
** Model loading with assimp. Took a few hours to realize I had to change the shaders to add a location for normals but it worked.
** Added my note model
** Realized some transforms were wrong. Reordered, relearned transform operation order
** Aligned notes with fretboard. Starting to look and feel like Guitar Hero!

* 2017-02-25 (Day 3)
** Initial camera work
** Texture for fretboard added to program
** Fretboard scrolls, but no notes yet
** Also organized the code a bit, putting shapes into a header
** Spent the afternoon relearning the little I knew from Blender and modeled a Guitar Hero style note gem. Also made a texture and a UV map!
*** Blender interpolates textures by default. A bit of a headache to solve it

* 2017-02-20 (Day 2)
** SDL2 + OpenGL context with gl3w for function pointers
*** GLAD didn't work for some reason. Can't remember why
** I can draw a triangle. Everything in 3D is triangles, so it's pretty much done

* 2017-02-19 (Day 1)
** Opened a window with SDL
